### Duck-Duck-Goose!

The goal is to guess the number of hidden ducks. At the start of the game, it'll ask to pick a number between 2-10 to guess the number of hidden ducks. Once you guess the number of hidden ducks correctly you win the game. It is continuous and can be played repeatedly. 
(The Game is still in development, First trail test for GitHub and first game created using html).
