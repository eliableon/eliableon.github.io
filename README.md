### Processing 5 Creation: Sir Topham Hatt from Thomas & Friends

Taking bit of an artistic approach with a software that you can create art with coding. Processing allowed pratice with basic coding that helped with understanding and working with code in HTML and JavaScript. It also gave a visual how websites like wix helps with that complicated processing of making art with code much easier. However, learning and viewing this way of creating art with code is also cool and maybe inspirational for a art code creation soon...
The drawing I made on processing was Sir Topham Hatt from Thomas & Friends because while creating the hat, this reminded me of him from one of my child hood shows. Then I started to customize the work as Sir Topham Hatt!

### Duck-Duck-Goose!

The goal is to guess the number of hidden ducks. At the start of the game, i'll ask to pick a number between 2-10 to guess the number of hidden ducks. Once you guess the number of hidden ducks correctly you win the game. It is continuous and can be played repeatedly. (The Game is still in development, First trail test for GitHub and first game created using html).

### Composition Creator

Using what we learned from Processing, This composition Creator uses an Algorithim that generates shapes and shapes of images with transparency to overlap each other and create an iamge that could be nicely displayed on the screen. This was to also test our knowledge on understanding algorithims and familiarize our selves with coding...

### Image detection

This was more of an advance project with creating image detection with using API's to predict what we add as an image, it can read what the image is. It also has a drag and drop feature that is cool to have and it also has a loading bar that is also cool to have and see when the detector is ready to predict.
